Unfortunatley I wasn't able to get too far in the project with the time allotted.

Accomplished:
- view list of chat threads
- view thread messages by clicking
- order messages chronologically
- display message sender's initials
- display time sent

Missing:
- name(s) of other members in chat above the chat thread
- ability to start a new conversation
- ability to reply to messages
- mobile responsiveness
- showing date as "today" or "yesterday" or "10/15/20" etc next to time message was sent
- autoscroll to bottom of thread
- unique url for conversations
